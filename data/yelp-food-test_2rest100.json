When I made my NOLA plans, I was a little intimidated to find out Mardi Gras is celebrated for a whole month- but aside from \"event\" pricing and a little longer waiting line it wasn't too bad.  Visited Acme by myself, so I asked for one seat at the bar.  Of course this was the night they turned over tables like crazy.  Groups of two, four, and even six were seated before me!  Ah well.  Finally bellied up to the bar, my bartender recommended the famous char-grilled oysters.  They were a little pricey, so I just ordered 1/2 dozen (also there was a wait for them), soI also ordered a dozen raw oysters and boo fries.\nThings were spaced evenly enough that I finished most of the raw oysters and boo fries before the char-grilled ones came.  The boo fries were described as poutine fries with gravy, cheese (in this case cheddar), and roast beef \"debris\" (scraps).  They were surprisingly good, and provided a nice counterpoint for the seafood.  \nThe star was the char-grilled oysters!  Sizzling and smelling heavenly, they were a treat on the tongue!  Dripping with melted butter, the char-grilling reminded of opihi on the hibachi.  This was the best item I've eaten in a long time!\nWith tax and tip, the bill came up to nearly $50.

My celiac-self was so thrilled to indulge in a couple classic NOLA dishes -- you know it's rough when so much of the cuisine out here is fried and/or begins with a delicious gluten-filled roux (I WANT TO EAT IT), so having even a few options on the menu is pretty rad. They make it clear on their menu that they don't have a separate cooking space for anything gluten-free, but I personally feel totally fine and really loved my meal.\n\nThis place was busy on a Sunday afternoon. There is zero waiting space inside, so poke your head in the door to let the hostess know you'd like a table, then you gotta wait outside. Being a party of one, I only had to wait like 4 minutes. I was seated by the window so I could watch people walk up and down Iberville Street. Always a fan of people-watching. I loved Acme's black and white checkered table cloths, all the neon red lights, and the overall energy. My hostess and waitress were both super sweet and checked on me often, calling me \"baby\" and \"sweetie\" and \"hon\" (as they call everyone). \n\nThey were out of chargrilled oysters during my visit (damn), but the 1/2 dozen oysters on the half shell with lemon and spicy cockail sauce were stellar. Like reaallllly really good. I love a good oyster but am picky with them -- I get easily turned off if they're too gooey, filled with too much liquid, or smell/taste too fishy. These were just right and I probably could have had a dozen alone. I also ordered a side of red beans and rice and a side of jambalaya. Salty with a nice heat, I enjoyed them both. But I totally loved the red beans & rice the most and even ordered a second side of them. Next time I'll get the plate with smoked sausage cause I wanted more more more. \n\nAlso ordered a glass of cabernet for $10, and my experience was about $35 overall (not including tip, but I definitely tipped well)! Seemed totally reasonable for this rad spot between Bourbon Street and Royal Street that always has a line out the door. I thoroughly enjoyed myself at this very New Orleans oyster bar.
