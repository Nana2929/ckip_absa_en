You order at the register. I got my two poboys to go. Jessica was very helpful. I asked if they made their roast beef and I love that they put their beef on the side. They do this so that your bread doesn't get too soggy by the time you get home. Very smart! Another interesting thing they do differently than any other place in New Orleans, they have a horseradish mayonnaise! Delish! My other poboy was the oyster dressed! Overstuffed, big juicy oysters! Just how I like them! If you like sliced pickles on your poboy, Bevi has really good nice sized slices of dill. \nI split the two so that I could taste both and they were both so good and they hit the spot! To top everything off I had a Barq's Red Cream Soda! Love a Barq's!\nHalf the restaurant were already eating crawfish! They looked really good with celery and all.

He was great at explaining the menu and giving suggestions. They had a 4 course special for $19.99 with several soup, salad and entree choices. I went with the 6 onion soup, Greek salad and an entree which name I cannot pronounce or remember. I'm not a soup person, so wasn't really feeling the soup. The salad was excellent! I will return for that alone. The entree was a flounder fish wrapped in pastry crust with a side of vegetables. The fish was big and thick. Personally, I prefer thinner pieces of fish. It had a good, distinct flavor in some portions and was lacking flavor in other portions. If the flavor would have carried all the way through, I would have loved it. I chose baklava for dessert and it was really good. I paid extra for a shot of Greek coffee (similar to espresso). It was different and strong, but I enjoyed it.

No need for a tour, really, as you're right in the middle of the brewery \"in-action,\" or at least that's what it feels like. It was fairly packed on a Friday night and it was loud. High ceilings. You know.\n\nZack and I shared a tasty burger ($10, with bacon, cheese, and fries). It was on the smaller side, but a steal for the price. The only problem? It was well-done. No room for requesting temperatures here, as they state on the menu \"no additions no substitutions,\" which frankly always puts a sour taste in my mouth. We also enjoyed a cherry and grilled radicchio salad, which was interesting.

I have been literally rendered speechless up until now.\n\nIn a world that has gone burger crazy, there are a lot of good burger places now-a-days. I like to categorize the burger restaurant industry into three categories: \n1. Chain fast food joints, you know what you're gonna get, and you're going to get it fast.  Some people look down upon such places but hey they fulfill a need.\n2. Sit down restaurants that serve burgers, the burgers are usually those 8oz huge burgers and you pay a load for it because you're sitting in a restaurant and it's usually ok, but their focus isn't really about the burger.\n3. Those places that only do burgers and do burgers well.  That's what category the Habit is in.  Sure they do other stuff, but why would you go there and order anything else but a charburger?  I honestly think they put the stuff on the menu because they had the extra space on the menu board or they had the lettuce for the burgers on hand anyway, so why not offer a salad. Sell one a day maybe to satisfy that weird-o vegetarian in the group.  Or maybe you're on some sort of self depravation, masochistic work-out/diet regiment that renders you temporarily insane and you go to the Habit and DON'T order a burger, whatever - point being go here and order a burger.  \nLike I said, the burgers are awesome, cooked medium, fresh ingredients, grilled onions, and best of all - they have bacon.  BACON makes everything taste better, and in this case it takes an already awesome burger and makes it... more awesome.  The fries are crispy and fresh and I haven't figured out why they are so good, but I'm going with CRACK.

With Rice and some lovely baby Bok Choy.\n\nNew favorite.... the Honey BBQ pork is phenomenal, tasty, smokey, tender... so very good! I let my girlfriend have a bite of it, and I thought she was going to jump up and wrestle me for the rest of it. She really like it also! (Thank Coty... you are right, it rocks!)\n\nThe Crispy Skin Pork is something I also love, and even make it at home occasionally. Properly cooked pork belly is a thing of beauty, and this was definitely a pageant winner! Succulent, tender, with a dusting of five spice powder, and just a thin layer of ultra crispy pork skin... YUM! Girlfriend was not as fond of this... a texture thing for her, although she loved the flavor.\n\nRice was good, and the Bok Choy was yummy with a drizzle of some sauce over it, not sure what it was, but good.\n\nGirlfriend ordered Sesame Chicken... and enjoyed it!  It was very good, although severely lacking in spicy heat (and yes, it is supposed to be spicy!) But they had some good chili oil on the table, fixed that right up!\n\nWe had ordered Jasmine tea also... and it was very good.\n\nServices was excellent... the lady who waited on us was wonderful. I even got fortune cookies (see a earlier review for another place to see why I say that!)  :)\n\nAll in all... great Chinese (Cantonese) food, and I even ordered a large portion of the Honey Pork to take to work with me tomorrow, to share with co-workers! They are in for a tasty surprise!\n\nAfter we left China Yuan, we wandered to the Chinese bakery that is nearby, and I got a sausage and scallion bun, a crispy pork bun, and a butter cream bun to go.

This is my favorite! It is a little more expensive but definitely worth it. Big serving size and the tastiest of all boba teas. I love the red rose tea, it smells like flowers and tastes delicious! Their boba beads are never hard, always cooked just right, and sweetened unlike any other boba!!! It's a must try! the beads I believe are sweetened with honey and it makes a huge difference in the taste! Highly recommend! Good study space as well, although occasionally gets loud intermittently.", "date": "2015-12-28 15:00:44"}]
